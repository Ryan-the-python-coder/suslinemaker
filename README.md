# Sus Line Maker

The **Sus Line Maker** is a fun Python tool that generates random "sus" (cheeky, innuendo-filled) lines.  
It fetches a community-maintained list of lines from [suslinemakermemory](https://github.com/Ryan-the-python-coder/suslinemakermemory) and lets you generate as many as you like.

⚠️ **Warning: Contains Suggestive Content** ⚠️  
This program is meant for entertainment and harmless fun.  
If you’re not comfortable with suggestive humor, you shouldn’t run this.

---

## Features
- Pulls fresh sus lines directly from GitHub each time you run it.  
- Lets you choose how many lines you want.  
- Option to generate more without restarting.  
- Foolproof input handling (`y/n`).  
- Graceful error handling if the data can’t be loaded.

## Usage

Download the file and run the script:

```bash
python suslinemaker.py
```

The script will:
1. Show a warning message (press Enter to continue, or close to exit).  
2. Pull the latest `sus_lines.txt` from the memory repo.  
3. Let you generate as many sus lines as you want.
